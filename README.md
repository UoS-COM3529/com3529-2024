### Lectures

Lectures will be held on **Tuesdays 1-2pm in the [Sir Henry Stephenson Building](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/acse/department/facilities/sir-henry-stephenson-building), Lecture Theatre 2**. 

### Practical Sessions (Labs)

Practical Sessions (Labs) will be held on **Thursdays 1-2pm in Computer Room 3 on level 2 of the [Diamond](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/engineering/diamond-engineering/floor-plans)**. These sessions will be a mix of coding and paper/pen exercises that are designed to help you prepare for the exam, based on that week's lecture materials. You'll need to bring your own laptop to the session, and have a reasonably up to date version of Java installed on it. 


## 3. Assessment

COM3529 is assessed 100% by an exam, to be scheduled sometime in Weeks 13, 14 or 15.

**The labs are designed to prepare you with exercises that will be similar to questions asked in the exam**. 

The exam may feature questions **requiring you to write Java code**. In this questions you will be expected to write code that is syntactically correct, including writing JUnit tests that may require calls to methods in libraries studied in the module.
